Why did I choose this?
When I was working on the Scrum quiz I was a bit unsure about what the "Cone of Uncertainty", ironic as that is. So I did some research and clicked through a bunch of articles.
After a bit of searching, I stumbled upon this article. The graphic at the top immediately caught my eye and I found myself reading the full article, which is suprising as I tend to be a skimmer.
I liked how straightforward the author's diction was. They outlined the ways in which all projects are unique. As a basic concept, I already had acknowledged that all projects are unique. But under the surface I had subconsciously considered SWE a potentially repetitive field. However, the author really opened my eyes to all the factors that differentiate projects. For example, working with different teams and third parties can completely change the work-place dynamic and re-invigorate a project!

I was also uncertain about the "Cone of Uncertainty"! The article was super effective in helping me understand the concept a little better. One of my biggest takeaways is struggle with budgeting. It's always hard to know just how much to budget during a specific period. Spending too much early may lead to a bigger risk but also maybe a bigger reward. The whole idea is not trying to predict a goal but to determine if targets are realistic over the span of the project's duration. 

A simple project to practice a few git/github workflows.  Replace the contents of this file with the contents indicated in the [instructions](./instructions.md).
